# 3D-to-2D-projections
Let us consider an **object O** with four 3D co-ordinates (-1, 0, 2), (1, 0, 5), (0, 1, 4), (0, -1, 3).

Part a: First function will take as input a set of 3D points, and returns as output a set of 2D points (𝑝1,𝑝2,𝑝3,𝑝4) that are the projection of the 3D points with the perspective camera.

Part b: second function to project the points using weak perspective projection (𝑞1,𝑞2,𝑞3,𝑞4).

Part c: Print out the figures showing the 2D projection of **(object o)** using weak perspective and perspective projection.

Pard d: Function to compute the sum of square differences (SSD) between two sets of image points.
Part e: function to rotate the object O counter clock wise by 45 degree around the Z-axis.
